AFM stands for _Aritzh's First Mod_ (Not very original, I know), however, this might be a temporary name.\r\n\r\n### Why make sucha an OmniMod?\r\n\r\nIt will help me make mods easily in the future. In addition, I might make some modding tutorials once AFM is finished, which makes me try to write the mod as cleanly as possible, so that it is easily readable.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
