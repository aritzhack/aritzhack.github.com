{"google":"UA-32149690-7","body":"# My Projects\r\nCurrently I'm developing a mod called [AFM](https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM), which will include as many features as possible.\r\n\r\nAlong with it, I'm keeping this webpage updated, as the mod updates.\r\n\r\n## [AFM](https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM)\r\n\r\n### What is it?\r\n\r\n[AFM](https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM) is, as stated before, a mod which will include everything I can think of. [AFM](https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM) stands for _Aritzh's First Mod_ (Not very original, I know), however, this might be a temporary name.\r\n\r\n### Why make a Omni-mod?\r\n\r\nIt will help me make mods easily in the future. In addition, I might make some modding tutorials once [AFM](https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM) is finished, which makes me try to write the mod as cleanly as possible, so that it is easily readable.\r\n\r\n### The Author (Me)\r\n\r\nI (Aritz Lopez, aritzhack, aritzh) am a 16 year old boy, who loves programming and playing games (if both mixed, even better). I am from Spain, where I currently live, and I am studying computer science in high school.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me in any of the following ways:\r\n* Email: [aritzhack@gmail.com](mailto:aritzhack@gmail.com)\r\n* Twitter: [@aritzh](https://twitter.com/aritzh)","note":"Don't delete this file!
