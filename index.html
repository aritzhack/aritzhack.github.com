          <h1>My Projects</h1>

<p>Currently I'm developing a mod called <a href="https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM">AFM</a>, which will focus on futuristic 
content, and will include as many features as possible.</p>

<p>Along with it, I'm keeping this webpage updated, as the mod updates.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM">AFM</a></h2>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM">AFM</a> is, as stated before, a mod which will include everything I can, using most of the Forge API's features. <a href="https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM">AFM</a> stands for <em>Aritzh's First Mod</em> (Not very original, I know), however, this might be a temporary name.</p>

<h3>Why make a Omni-mod (Mod that includes lots of things)?</h3>

<p>Well, I'm a newbie modder, so I don't know a lot about it. That's why I try to learn and implement as many things as possible, so that when I need to add something I already added, I know how to do it. In addition, I might make some modding tutorials once <a href="https://github.com/aritzhack/AFM">AFM</a> is "finished" (or at leas when it has a bunch of interesting features), which makes me try to write the mod as cleanly as possible, so that it is easily readable.</p>

<h3>The Author (Me)</h3>

<p>I (Aritz Lopez, aritzhack, aritzh) am a 16 year old boy, who loves programming and playing games (if both mixed, even better). I am from Spain, where I currently live, and I am studying computer science in high school.</p>
